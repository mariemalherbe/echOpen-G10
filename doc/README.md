## About
This is the docuemntation repo attached to the Android App. You'll find the *javadoc* generated from Android Studio and the high level documentation related to the architecture. 

The architecture descpritions relies for the moment on some schema. These will be described more in depth in a near future.

** Remark **

We excluded from the *javadoc* some classes because of we make use of `RenderScript` which is not recognized by the javadocizer of `Android Studio`. If anyone has some guess, please contact at clement@echopen.org or nowami@echopen.org.
